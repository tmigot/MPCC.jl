# MPCC [Package in Dev]

Documentation for MPCC.jl.

## Purpose

Set of tools to model the mathematical program with complementarity/switching/vanishing constraints.
The package follows the same structure as the [NLPModels](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/NLPModels.jl).

The package contains the basic tools to use the [Stopping](https://github.com/Goysa2/Stopping.jl) framework.

## Example
